            <ul>
                <li><b>fills : Fill[]</b> : Allows areas between multiple lines to be filled with a color.</li>
                <li><b>z : float</b> : Objects can now easily appear above or below other objects using a layer-based system.</li>

            <h1>Additional Information</h1>
            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>First released in December 2010, HaxBall was originally implemented using the flash player and used RTMFP to create peer 2 peer connections in a way similar to WebRTC. Unfortunately flash player has been discontinued and so the move to HTML5 was required.</p>
            <h2>Author</h2>
            <p>HaxBall is made by Mario Carbajal (aka basro). Special thanks to my brother, gliptic, qualo and jonsul for their miscellaneous help.</p>
